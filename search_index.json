In Vue, components are our units. \nVue Test Utils is geared towards testing Vue components. Let's look at a quick overview.\nWriting unit tests with Vue Test Utils\nThe process of unit testing Vue components with Vue Test Utils is to mount a component in memory. Mounting a component is a bit like setting the component running. The mount and shallow methods returns a Wrapper object that contains the mounted component, and helper methods to perform assertions on the component and to traverse the render tree.\nimport { mount } from 'vue-test-utils'\n\nconst wrapper = mount(Component) // returns a Wrapper containing a mounted Component instance\nwrapper.text() // returns text of mounted component inside Wrapper\nwrapper.vm // the mounted Vue instance\n\nshallow stubs the children of a component before it mounts it:\nimport { shallow } from 'vue-test-utils'\n\nconst wrapper = shallow(Component) // returns a Wrapper containing a mounted Component instance\nwrapper.vm // the mounted Vue instance\n\nOften, you'll need to pass data to the Component. For example, you might need to pass props to a component. You can do this with mount options:\nimport { mount } from 'vue-test-utils'\n\nmount(Component, {\n  propsData: {\n    aProp: 'some value'\n  }\n})\n\nFor a full list of options, please see the mount options section of the docs.\nVue follows a pattern of injecting properties. Normally this is done in a main.js file that creates the Vue instance. This won't be run when you're unit testing, so you'll often need to add properties to the Vue instance yourself. You can do that with the intercept option.\nimport { mount } from 'vue-test-utils'\n\nconst $store = {\n  getters: {}\n}\nmount(Component, {\n  intercept: {\n    $store // adds the $store object to the Vue instance before mounting component\n  }\n})\n\nTesting single file components\nMost Vue tests will be testing single file components (SFCs). These files require precompilation before they can be run in Node or in the browser.\nThe two recommended ways are to test with a Jest preprocessor, or use Webpack.\nYou can learn how to test SFCs by reading these guides:\n\nTesting SFCs with Jest\n\nKnowing what to test\nIt's impossible to say exactly what you should test and what you shouldn't, but there are some general rules you can follow.\nYou should write test for custom logic inside Vue components. The best way to test the logic of component is to make sure an input creates the expected output. \nFor example, imagine we have a Counter component that increments a display counter by 1 each time a button is clicked. The test should perform the click and assert that the counter increased by 1. This ensures that your test is not implementation specific. You can rewrite the logic of the test, and as long as clicking a button still updates the counter text, the test will pass.\nResourcs\n\nGetting started with Jest\nTesting SFCs with Jest\n\n"},"guides/choosing-a-test-runner.html":{"url":"guides/choosing-a-test-runner.html","title":"Choosing a test runner","keywords":"","body":"Choosing a test runner\nA test runner is a program that runs tests.\nThere are many popular JavaScript test runners, and Vue Test Utils works in all of them.

Learn more about Jest  So let's get started.\nTo test SFCs, we need to compile the files before running them in node.\nNote: Jest uses a jest-vue transformer. It does not contain all the features of vue-loader, like custom block support and style loading. To use them, read the testing SFCs with Mocha guide\nSetting up Jest\nThe first thing to do is install Jest:\n$ npm install --save-dev jest\n\nNext we need to define a unit script in our package.json.\n// package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"jest\"\n  }\n}\n\nAs you probably want to use latest javascript capabilities inside your specs though, it's recommendable to enable babel for the project.\n$ npm install --save-dev babel babel-jest babel-preset-env\n\nIf you’ve not heard of babel-preset-env, it basically allows compiling the JS based on the browsers you plan to support. Get more info here: babel-preset-env\nWe need to add a .babelrc file, to tell babel to use the env preset:\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"env\"]\n}\n\nBy default, Jest doesn't recognize .vue files. So we need to tell Jest how to handle them. To do that we need to install jest-vue, which preprocesses .vue files:\nnpm install --sav-dev jest-vue\nIn our package.json, we need to add a field to tell Jest how to treat .vue files:\n// package.json\n{\n  \"jest\": {\n    \"moduleFileExtensions\": [\n      \"js\",\n      \"json\",\n      \"vue\"\n    ],\n    \"transform\": {\n      \"^.+\\\\.js$\": \"/node_modules/babel-jest\",\n      \".*\\\\.(vue)$\": \"/node_modules/jest-vue\"\n    },\n    \"mapCoverage\": true\n  }\n}\n\nThat's pretty much everything necessary to do before writing the first specs.\nWhere should my tests live\nBy default, jest will pick up all files that have a .spec.js or .test.js extension. If this does not fit your needs, it's possible to chang the testRegex in the config section in the package.json file.\nJest recommends to create a __tests__ folder, but feel free to do as you like. Just know ahead of time, that when using the snapshot feature, snapshots will get stored in a __snapshot__ folder.\nExample Spec\nIf you are familiar with Jasmine, or similar test libraries you should feel at home in Jest right away.

It compiles source files in webpack before running Mocha.\nSetting up mocha-webpack\nThe first thing to do is install Mocha, mocha webpack, webpack and webpack loaders:\nnpm install --save-dev vue-test-utils mocha mocha-webpack webpack webpack-node-externals vue vue-loader css-loader babel-loader\n\nNext we need to define a unit script in our package.json.\n// package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"unit\": \"mocha-webpack --webpack-config build/webpack.conf.js test --recursive --require test/setup.js\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis script tells mocha-webpack to get the webpack config from build/webpack.conf.js, run all test files in the test directory and run test/setup.js before the tests.\nLet's create the setup.js script first.\nVue Test Utils requires a browser environment to run. We can set one up using browser-env (a wrapper around JSDOM).\nLet's install that:\nnpm install --save-dev browser-env\nCreate a test/setup.js file and paste the following code in:\nrequire('browser-env')();\nThis adds a browser environment to node, so that Vue Test Utils can run correctly.\nNext, we need to install babel and configure it so we can use ES6 features in our JavaScript:\nnpm install --save-dev babel-core babel-preset-env\n\nand create a .babelrc file in the root of the project, that tells babel to use the env preset:\n// .babelrc\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"env\"]\n}\n\nbabel-preset-env allows compiling the JS based on the browsers you plan to support. Get more info here: babel-preset-env\nNow we need to create a webpack config file.

It calls Vuex actions.\n\n    \n        \n        Click\n    \n\n\n\nimport { mapActions } from 'vuex'\n\nexport default{\n  methods: {\n    ...mapActions([\n      'actionClick'\n    ]),\n    actionInputIfTrue: function actionInputIfTrue (event) {\n      const inputValue = event.target.value\n      if (inputValue === 'input') {\n        this.$store.dispatch('actionInput', { inputValue })\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nFor the purposes of this test, we don’t care what the actions do, or what the store looks like. We just need to know that these actions are being fired when they should, and that they are fired with the expected value.\nTo test this, we need to pass a mock store to Vue when we mount our component.\nLet’s see what this looks like:\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport { mount } from 'vue-test-utils'\nimport sinon from 'sinon'\nimport { expect } from 'chai'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport 'babel-polyfill'\nimport Actions from '../../../src/components/Actions'\n\nVue.use(Vuex)\n\ndescribe('Actions.vue', () => {\n  let actions\n  let store\n\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    actions = {\n      actionClick: sinon.stub(),\n      actionInput: sinon.stub()\n    }\n    store = new Vuex.Store({\n      state: {},\n      actions\n    })\n  })\n\n  it('calls store action actionInput when input value is input and an input even is fired', () => {\n    const wrapper = mount(Actions, { store })\n    const input = wrapper.find('input')[0]\n    input.element.value = 'input'\n    input.trigger('input')\n    expect(actions.actionInput.calledOnce).to.equal(true)\n  })\n\n  it('does not call store action actionInput when input value is not input and an input even is fired', () => {\n    const wrapper = mount(Actions, { store })\n    const input = wrapper.find('input')[0]\n    input.element.value = 'not input'\n    input.trigger('input')\n    expect(actions.actionInput.calledOnce).to.equal(false)\n  })\n\n  it('calls store action actionClick when button is clicked', () => {\n    const wrapper = mount(Actions, { store })\n    wrapper.find('button')[0].trigger('click')\n    expect(actions.actionClick.calledOnce).to.equal(true)\n  })\n})\n\nWhat’s happening here? First we tell Vue to use Vuex with the Vue.use method. This is just a wrapper around Vue.use.\nWe then make a mock store by calling new Vuex.store with our mock values. We only pass it the actions, since that’s all we care about.\nThe actions are sinon stubs. The stubs give us methods to assert whether the actions were called or not.\nWe can then assert in our tests that the action stub was called when expected.\nNow the way we define the store might look a bit foreign to you.\nWe’re using beforeEach to ensure we have a clean store before each test. beforeEach is a mocha hook that’s called before each test. In our test, we are reassigning the store variables value. If we didn’t do this, the sinon stubs would need to be automatically reset. It also lets us change the state in our tests, without it affecting later tests.\nThe most important thing to note in this test is that we create a mock Vuex store and then pass it to vue-test-utils.\nGreat, so now we can mock actions, let’s look at mocking getters.\nMocking Getters\n\n    \n        {{inputValue}}\n        {{clicks}}\n    \n\n\n\n    import { mapGetters } from 'vuex'\n\nexport default{\n      computed: mapGetters([\n        'clicks',\n        'inputValue'\n      ])\n    }\n\n\nThis is a fairly simple component. It renders the result of the getters clicks and inputValue. Again, we don’t really care about what those getters returns – just that the result of them is being rendered correctly.\nLet’s see the test:\nimport 'babel-polyfill'\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport { mount } from 'vue-test-utils'\nimport { expect } from 'chai'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport Actions from '../../../src/components/Getters'\n\nVue.use(Vuex)\n\ndescribe('Getters.vue', () => {\n  let getters\n  let store\n\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    getters = {\n      clicks: () => 2,\n      inputValue: () => 'input'\n    }\n\n    store = new Vuex.Store({\n      getters\n    })\n  })\n\n  it('Renders state.inputValue in first p tag', () => {\n    const wrapper = mount(Actions, { store })\n    const p = wrapper.find('p')[0]\n    expect(p.text()).to.equal(getters.inputValue())\n  })\n\n  it('Renders state.clicks in second p tag', () => {\n    const wrapper = mount(Actions, { store })\n    const p = wrapper.find('p')[1]\n    expect(p.text()).to.equal(getters.clicks().toString())\n  })\n})\n\nThis test is similar to our actions test. We create a mock store before each test, pass it as an option when we call mount, and assert that the value returned by our mock getters is being rendered.\nThis is great, but what if we want to check our getters are returning the correct part of our state?\nMocking with Modules\nModules are useful for separating out our store into manageable chunks. They also export getters. We can use these in our tests.\nLet’s look at our component:\n\n    \n        Click\n        {{moduleClicks}}\n    \n\n\n\n    import { mapActions, mapGetters } from 'vuex'\n\nexport default{\n      methods: {\n        ...mapActions([\n          'moduleActionClick'\n        ])\n      },\n\n      computed: mapGetters([\n        'moduleClicks'\n      ])\n    }\n\n\nSimple component that includes one action and one getter.\nAnd the test:\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport { mount } from 'vue-test-utils'\nimport sinon from 'sinon'\nimport { expect } from 'chai'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport 'babel-polyfill'\nimport Modules from '../../../src/components/Modules'\nimport module from '../../../src/store/module'\n\nVue.use(Vuex)\n\ndescribe('Modules.vue', () => {\n  let actions\n  let state\n  let store\n\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    state = {\n      module: {\n        clicks: 2\n      }\n    }\n\n    actions = {\n      moduleActionClick: sinon.stub()\n    }\n\n    store = new Vuex.Store({\n      state,\n      actions,\n      getters: module.getters\n    })\n  })\n\n  it('calls store action moduleActionClick when button is clicked', () => {\n    const wrapper = mount(Modules, { store })\n    const button = wrapper.find('button')[0]\n    button.trigger('click')\n    expect(actions.moduleActionClick.calledOnce).to.equal(true)\n  })\n\n  it('Renders state.inputValue in first p tag', () => {\n    const wrapper = mount(Modules, { store })\n    const p = wrapper.find('p')[0]\n    expect(p.text()).to.equal(state.module.clicks.toString())\n  })\n})\n\nTo have a look at what the module file looks like, check out the repo.\nSo now we’re importing getters from out Vuex store module. This means we need to mock the state.\nIs this a good thing? Well, it means we’re testing that the state we expect will be returned by the getter. But this is a unit test, so maybe we should test that in a store test.\nI’ll leave it up to you whether you want to test the state or not.\nHopefully this tutorial has helped you understand how to mock Vuex in Vue unit tests.\nIf you have any questions, leave a comment.\n"},"common-gotchas.html":{"url":"common-gotchas.html","title":"Common gotchas","keywords":"","body":"Common gotchas\nbrowser environment\nVue Test Utils must be run in a browser environment. This means you can run it in a browser (not recommended), or you can run it in node using a virtual browser, like JSDOM.\nJest sets up JSDOM automatically, so it is the easiest way for you to run Vue Test Utils in node.\ncreateLocalVue\ncreateLocalVue returns an extended Vue class so you can add mixins, directives, components and plugins without affecting the global Vue class.\nUnfortunately, many plugins have internal checks that stop them from being installed more than once.\nCurrently, Vuex cannot be installed on more than once instance. However, you can change the store. So one install should be fine. See the guide on using with Vuex\nAlso, Vue Router needs two options set to false to be installed more than once:\nimport createLocalVue from 'vue-test-utils'\nimport VueRouter from 'vue-router'\n\nconst localVue = createLocalVue()\nVueRouter.installed = false\nVueRouter.install.installed = false\nlocalVue.use(VueRouter)\n\nThe alternative is to stub the properties you want to test, instead of installing the plugin.\nFor example, if your test relies on this.$route.params.id, stub $route using intercept:\nmount(Component, {\n  intercept: {\n    $route: {\n      params: {\n        id: true\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n"}}}
